# CS 303 - Assignment 2 - Manuel Buffa
# Part 1) The purpose of this program is to create a Linked List class.
# Then to create functions that replicate the Linked List class library.
# Part 2) The next part is to create and manipulate an integer Stack.
# The Stack is to utilize the built-in vector class for its function.
#
# Note: I built this program to incorporate both functionalities requested.
# The  List and Stack are available via user menus.
#  
# Part 1) I have started with a Main Menu.
