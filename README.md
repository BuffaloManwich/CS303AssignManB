# CS 303 - Assignment 2 - Manuel Buffa
# Part 1) The purpose of this program is to create a Linked List class.
# Then to create functions that replicate the Linked List class library.
# Part 2) The next part is to create and manipulate an integer Stack.
# The Stack is to utilize the built-in vector class for its function.
#
# Note: I built this program to incorporate both functionalities requested.
# The List operations and Stack operations are available via user menus.
# Users will choose from the numerical options for menu navigation and operations.
#  
# Part 1) I started with a Main Menu.

# Next I have the initial sub menus, Linked List Menu and Stack Menu

#
# Regarding the Linked List Menu, the build option requires a number of integers and then iterates a value input the number of times entered

# 
# The Modify List Menu has 2 submenus, Add and Delete Nodes. I'll only give one screen shot and description of a few samples from these two. The functions are very similar in operation.

# The above operation shows an example of removing a Node at an index.  
#
# The following screenshot shows the View List Menu and the View at Index choice.

# This wraps up the Linked List operation examples. All functionality works. The code has robust input verification built-in.
# 
# The Stack Menu has many fewer operations and didn't require a new object class to setup. 
# The first option is Build Stack

# The following example shows a value being pushed onto the Stack.

# After exploring a few more options exit the program.
